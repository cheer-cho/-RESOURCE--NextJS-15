# Next.js 15 Beginner Project

This repository contains the code I wrote while following the [Learn Next.js 15 in 1 Hour - Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EgI9WH8q1A).

## 📌 Overview

This project explores key Next.js 15 concepts, including:

- Server and Client Components
- App Router (`app/` directory)
- Layouts and Nested Layouts
- Navigation with `Link` and `useRouter`
- Route Handlers (API routes in `app/api/`)
- Data Fetching Strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR, and Client Fetching)
- Server Actions
- Authentication

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
